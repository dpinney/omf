Release 1.4.2:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (08-Dec-14)

* Modified the "build" script to better accommodate the Mac OSX platform,
  and fixed a contradiction in the documentation relating to the
  description of the situational and time variability parameters
  used in the ITM and ITWOM propagation models.
  (Thanks John M. Vanderau, AA0DN)

* Modified the man pages for improved rendering.  (Thanks Randy Berry, N3LRX)

* Added a field limit in the citydecoder utility to prevent crashing if
  the coordinate file being read should contain unexpectantly large fields.
  (Thanks David Binderman)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.4.1:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (08-Jan-14):

* The copyright restriction on the ITWOM 3.0 propagation model has
  been removed.  ITWOM 3.0 code may now be used and modified under
  the GPLv2 license.

* Commented out unused variables and calculations in itwom3.0.cpp
  to eliminate gcc warnings about unused but set variables.

* Fixed a bug that caused path loss graphs to be plotted incorrectly.

* Embellished the "citydecoder" utility to handle U.S. Census County
  Subdivision files, thereby providing an additional source of city
  names and locations not necessarily contained in previously handled
  Incorporated Places/Census Designated data files.

* Corrected the image size written to the header of Xastir-compatible
  .ppm maps.

* Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the "Mode of propagation" from
  appearing in Path Analysis reports when running in -oldtim mode.

* Added a -log command line switch that allows SPLAT!'s command line
  and all associated switches and arguments to be written to a logfile
  for future reference or re-execution at a later time.

* Modified SPLAT!'s "build" script for better handling of OSX.
  (Thanks Glen Bizeau, VE9GLN)

* Changed some coding to eliminate compilation warnings produced by
  recent versions of GCC.

* Brought the documentation up to date.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.4.0:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (14-Mar-11):

* Supplemented Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain Propagation Model
  (ITM v7.0) code with an improved Irregular Terrain with Obstructions
  Model (ITWOM v3.0) by Sid Shumate / Givens & Bell, Inc. that corrects
  multiple errors present in the original ITM code, and incorporates
  Radiative Transfer Engine (RTE) computations in the line-of-sight
  range.  The older ITM model used in previous releases of SPLAT! may
  be invoked by using the new -olditm command-line switch.

* Introduced a new -sc command line option that provides contour smoothing.

* Added path-loss/signal-strength color keys to GoogleEarth signal contour
  overlays.

* The "build" and "configure" scripts now attempt to warn the user that
  configuring SPLAT-HD for 6x6, 7x7, or 8x8 degree operation requires a
  64-bit environment, and compile SPLAT-HD for the appropriate memory
  model.

* Fixed a bug that caused misinterpretation of ERP values expressed in
  .lrp files.

* Fixed bugs in srtm2sdf.c that affected proper handling of .BIL files
  (Thanks David Pearce), and compiler warnings in splat.cpp and srtm2sdf.c
  (Thanks Jesse Caulfield and Charles Escobar).

* Brought the documentation up to date.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.3.0:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (11-Apr-09):

* Introduced one arc-second high-resolution versions of SPLAT!
  (splat-hd) and the srtm2sdf utility (srtm2sdf-hd) to permit
  detailed topographic and RF signal analyzes based on SRTM-1
  digital elevation models.

* Introduced a new configure script that generates the appropriate
  MAXPAGES parameter prior to compiling SPLAT! based on user
  interaction at configuration time.

* Added transmitter EIRP, estimated received signal power level
  (in dBm), estimated received signal power density (in dBW/m^2),
  and received signal power density to Path Analysis Reports.
  EIRP can also now be expressed as dBm in place of ERP in
  Watts in .lrp files.

* Added a new mapping mode that plots contours of received signal
  power levels in dBm using the new -dbm option.  New .dcf files
  control the color scheme of the plotted contours.

* The function of the -db option has been expanded to serve as a
  contour threshold limit for all three mapping modes (path loss,
  signal strength, and signal power level).

* New -ano and -ani (alphanumeric output and input) options have
  replaced the -plo and -pli (path loss output and input) options,
  and can contain either path loss data (as before), field strength
  data (new), or received signal power level data (new).  Path loss
  figures in .ano files ignore the effects of transmit antenna
  pattern, while field strength and received signal power levels
  take antenna pattern into account.

* Uniform ground clutter height can now be specified using the new
  -gc switch.

* Several bugs in SPLAT!'s UDT file handling were fixed.

* Bugs affecting the operation of the -f switch were identified
  and fixed.

* The reported field strength and the corresponding voltage induced
  across the receive antenna in Path Analysis Reports were found to
  be 2.14 dB too low.  The cause was identified and fixed.

* Some modifications were made in coding and scripting in response to
  changes that have occured in the latest versions of gcc and bash.

* The documentation was updated to reflect all the improvements.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.2.3:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (30-Jul-08):

* Fixed a problem that sometimes caused SPLAT! to hang indefinitely
  when reading some cartographic boundary files on some platforms.

* Fixed a problem introduced in v1.2.2 that sometimes caused black
  horizontal and/or vertical dotted lines to appear in path-loss
  and signal strength contour plots.

* The UDT file switch was described as -udt in the documentation,
  but recognized as -u in SPLAT!.  SPLAT! was modified to reflect
  the documentation.

* The -R option can now increase (as well as limit) the .ppm image
  size when generating topographic maps.

* Dots ('.') are now permitted in the base of filenames passed to SPLAT!
 
* Further improvements in accuracy were made to both SPLAT! and the
  srtm2sdf utility.  Users are encouraged to re-create their .sdf
  files using the latest version of srtm2sdf for the best performance. 

* The loading and display of cartographic boundary files now works
  for any region of the planet.

* A -gpsav command-line switch option was added to instruct SPLAT! to
  preserve the temporary working files it creates when invoking gnuplot.
  This permits users to view and edit these files, and even re-run
  gnuplot outside of SPLAT! (Tnx John McMellen)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.2.2:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (10-May-08):

* Cleared up some very small inaccuracies (+/- 1 pixel) through better
  numerical rounding techniques.

* Transmitter site location names now appear in .ppm maps even if no
  city location files are loaded into SPLAT!

* Fixed a problem that prevented operation over paths that extended
  across the Prime Meridian.

* Fixed a problem that produced incorrect TX-to-RX distances in the
  Site Analysis Report when the -metric switch was used. (Tnx Martin, M0ADY)

* When generating .ppm map contours, SPLAT! is now slightly more liberal
  when loading SDF files to help ensure the contour doesn't get cut off
  if it should approach the boundary of an SDF file.

* Added a new utility called "bearing" (under utils) that determines
  distance and azimuth bearings between two site location (.qth) files.

* The man page installation process was improved.

* Some very minor documentation updates were made.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.2.1:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (18-Oct-07):

* SPLAT! now imports transmitter effective radiated power information and
  predicts received field strength signal levels (dBuV/m) and antenna
  voltage based on the transmitter's antenna pattern, computed path loss,
  and ERP.  ERP information is specified on the ninth line of SPLAT! .lrp
  files. 

* The ability to plot signal strength contour maps has been added.  The
  color schemes for plotting signal strength and path loss contour maps
  can now be customized by editing the contents of .scf and .lcf files
  for each transmitter site.  In addition, both signal strength and path
  loss contour maps can now be generated for multiple transmitter sites,
  with the greatest signal strength (or least path loss) illustrated in
  overlapping regions between sites.

* A new -ngs switch assigns all topography to the color white in .ppm
  contour maps.  The white background can be made transparent using
  simple graphics utilities for merging SPLAT! contour maps with other
  Mercator projection maps and graphics files of equivalent size and
  resolution.

* Path loss and signal strength contour regions can now be exported to
  Google Earth as a semi-transparent ground overlay using the -kml switch.

* The default contour map filename now defaults to the basename of the
  transmitter site .qth file (or first transmitter site within a network)
  with a .ppm extension (rather than "map.ppm").

* The Fresnel zone clearance percentage, which was fixed at 60% in the
  past, is now user-definable using the new -fz command-line option.
 
* Information previously contained in SPLAT! Obstruction Reports has now
  been merged with Longley-Rice path loss information into a single Path
  Analysis report (with a .txt extension).  (Longley-Rice output (.lro)
  files are no longer generated.)

* Graph plotting (the -l option) no longer needs to be forced to perform
  a Longley-Rice path analysis in point-to-point mode.  If a .lrp file is
  available and contains the information needed, Longley-Rice path loss
  information will be automatically included in SPLAT!'s Path Analysis
  Report when performing a point-to-point analysis.

* In addition to information previously contained, SPLAT! Path Loss Output
  (-plo) files now contain additional information including path loss
  considering the effects of the transmitting antenna's radiation pattern
  (if pattern data is available), and field strength values (dBuV/m)
  based on pattern data and ERP data (if available).  An asterisk at
  the end of each line indicates the path to the point referenced in
  the file is obstructed by terrain.

* The srtm2sdf utility now handles 3-arc second SRTM in .BIL (Band
  Interleaved by Line) format, as well as the usual .HGT format.

* SPLAT!'s associated itm.cpp file was updated to include the latest
  public domain ITM code released on June 26, 2007.

* References in source code and documentation to "slots" and "MAXSLOTS"
  have been changed to "pages" and "MAXPAGES", respectively.

* Two bugs affecting the plotting of Fresnel zones were identified and fixed.

* A bug that produced some erroneous elevation angles in SPLAT! Path Loss
  Output (-plo option) files was identified and fixed.

* Text documentation in Spanish was added (thanks to Charles Escobar).

* The build scripts were modified to permit successful compilation with
  bzip2-1.0.4 libraries.  (Thanks to Janek, SQ5MJL)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.2.0:
By John A. Magliacane, <kd2bd@amsat.org> (22-Dec-2006):

* All graph plotting has been enhanced to include distances, azimuths,
  and in some cases, elevation angles, in numeric form.  Height
  plots (-h option) now include a contour of the Earth's curvature.
  A new -H option was added that behaves the same as -h, except its
  display of heights is normalized to the heights of the endpoints
  along the plotted path.  Graphs now default to PNG rather than GIF
  format to reflect gnuplot's current trend away from .gif output.
  (.gif is still available if your version of gnuplot supports it.)
  Postscript output is now generated in enhanced color.

* SPLAT! can now determine and plot Fresnel Zone clearances.  A new
  -f command-line option permits the Fresnel Zone frequency (in MHz)
  to be specified, otherwise it can be determined from .lrp files when
  path-loss calculations are performed.  Antenna height requirements
  for 60% clearance (0.6 F1) and 100% clearance (F1) of the First
  Fresnel Zone now appear in Obstruction Reports.  These zones are
  also displayed graphically in height plots (-h or -H options).

* Support for antenna radiation patterns has been added.  SPLAT! now
  reads normalized azimuth and elevation antenna field pattern data
  from separate .az and .el files when Longley-Rice studies are performed.
  One degree azimuth and one tenth degree elevation pattern resolution
  is supported along with azimuthal pattern rotation and mechanical
  vertical beam tilt. 

* A bug in the interpretation of the -n and -N command-line options
  was fixed.

* Negative geographical coordinates in DMS format are now (hopefully)
  interpreted and displayed better than before.

* SPLAT! data handling can be changed from imperial units (feet/miles)
  to metric (meters/kilometers) units using the new -metric switch.

* SPLAT! can now generate topographic maps without plotting
  line-of-sight or path loss coverage.  These maps are centered
  approximately on the given tx_site, extend out to a radius
  provided by the -R switch, and can be populated with county
  boundaries and city names, just like SPLAT!'s traditional
  line-of-sight and path loss maps. 

* Support for user-defined terrain files (ground clutter) has been
  added.

* SPLAT! can now generate .geo Geo-reference Information Files
  when .ppm topography and coverage maps are created, permitting
  the integration of SPLAT! generated maps with X Amateur Station
  Tracking and Information Reporting (www.xastir.org) software.

* SPLAT! can now generate .kml Keyhole Markup Language files that
  when imported into "Google Map", dramatically illustrate the RF
  path between transmitter and receiver locations when performing
  point-to-point analyses.

* Support for exporting Longley-Rice path loss contour studies to
  external data files has been included.  SPLAT! path loss files can
  be used for performing coverage or interference studies outside of
  SPLAT!.  They can also be modified externally (with antenna pattern
  data, for example) through scripts or small utilities, and imported
  back into SPLAT! to generate coverage maps based on the revised
  data without having to re-run any time intensive Longley-Rice path
  loss calculations.

* The documentation was updated to reflect the new features and
  functionality of the software.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.1.1:
By John A. Magliacane, <kd2bd@amsat.org> (01-Apr-2006):

* An srtm2sdf utility was added to permit SPLAT Data Files to be
  derived from the latest 3-arc second SRTM (STS-99 Space Shuttle
  Radar Topography Mission) digital elevation model data.  The
  quality of this data is *significantly* higher than that of older
  USGS Digital Elevation Models previously used by SPLAT!.  Despite
  the higher quality, some voids in SRTM data sets still exist.
  When voids are detected, the srtm2sdf utility replaces them with
  equivalent elevation data found in existing SDF files (presumably
  generated from older USGS elevation models).  If older SDF files
  are not available, voids are handled through pixel averaging or
  direct replacement.

* Coding changes were made that in concert with the new srtm2sdf utility
  should allow SPLAT! to function over all regions of the planet for
  which SRTM-3 elevation data is available.

* SPLAT's SDF search path priority has been changed.  SPLAT! now
  searches for needed SDF files in the current working directory first.
  If the needed file isn't found, SPLAT! then searches in the path
  specified by the -d command-line option, or in the $HOME/.splat_path
  file.

* The color scheme used by SPLAT! in the generation of Longley-Rice
  path loss maps was noticeably improved.

* A new command-line option (-db) was added to allow constraints
  to be placed on the maximum attenuation contours plotted on
  path loss maps.

* A possible array overflow condition in the ReadPath() function was
  identified and fixed.

* Some very slight coding modifications were made to permit warning-free
  compilation under GCC 4.x.x.

* The usgs2sdf utility was modified John Gabrysch (jgabby@gmail.com) to
  properly handle the latest USGS DEM file format, and to properly scale
  Alaska tiles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.1.0:
By John A. Magliacane, <kd2bd@amsat.org> (29-Jan-2004):

* Extensively modified by J. D. McDonald in January 2004 to include
  the Longley-Rice propagation model using C++ code from NTIA/ITS.
  In addition to analyzing line-of-sight propagation paths, SPLAT!
  now generates multi-color maps illustrating predicted signal
  strength (path loss), path loss graphs, path loss reports,
  and terrain height graphs.  The default earth radius, as well
  as the default line-of-sight and path loss analysis range used
  by SPLAT! may also be modified using new command-line options.

* splat.c was renamed to splat.cpp to reflect changes necessary
  to merge with Longley-Rice C++ code.  A C++ compiler (gcc/g++)
  is now required to compile SPLAT!.

* The documentation was updated to reflect the new features
  of the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.0.3:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (10-Jun-2002):

* Coverage areas are now processed four times faster than before.
  (TNX KC6YSO)

* Determination of antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) based
  on FCC Part 73.313(d) (Prediction of coverage) has been added.

* Site analysis report generation has been added when coverage mode
  is invoked.  These reports include ground height above mean sea
  level, antenna height above mean sea level, antenna height above
  average terrain, and average terrain calculated at azimuths of 0,
  45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees.

* Added site location information in degree, minute, second format,
  as well as antenna height above average terrain to the content of
  obstruction reports.

* Elevations below sea-level are now safely handled.

* Greyscale of topographic maps generated by SPLAT! is now referenced
  between the highest and lowest elevations in the survey, instead of
  between the highest elevation and sea-level.  This change in reference
  permits regions below sea level to be discernible in the map, and
  allows subtle terrain variations to be clearly evident over regions
  having relatively flat terrain.

* The documentation was updated.

* Several other minor coding changes/bug fixes were made.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.0.2:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (14-May-2002):

* SPLAT! now buffers data while reading bzip2 compressed SPLAT
  Data Files (SDFs).  A 100 MHz Pentium now loads compressed SDF
  files 208% faster than before, and takes only 2 seconds longer
  than an uncompressed file.

* Configuration, compilation, and installation scripts now invoke
  bash instead of sh.  The -ffast-math compiler option was removed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.0.1:
By John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (22-Apr-2002):

* The maximum number of transmitter/repeater sites handled
  per analysis has been increased from two to four.

* Improved the configuration, compilation, and installation scripts.
  Now ./configure compiles and installs the program, man page, and
  all associated utilities in one command.

* Some minor coding changes were made, including the addition of an
  #include <stdlib.h> in each of the utilities to silence a compilation
  warning issued by gcc version 3.x.x about the use of the exit() function.

* The README and documentation files were updated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.0.0:
by John A. Magliacane <kd2bd@amsat.org> (08-Apr-2002):

* First public release of SPLAT!
