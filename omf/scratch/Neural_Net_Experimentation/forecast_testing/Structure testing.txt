-------- LAYERS -------
3 layers + half 	2.9, 3
4 layers + half		3.1, 3.5; 1.14, 1.12
5 layers + half		1.7, 1.8; 3.4, 3.1
6 layers + half		2.0, 1.7; 3.0, 3.15
5 layers		1.17, 1.02; 2.3, 2.4

KEEP 5 layers

-------- POLYNOMIAL ----
without tempc^2		1.2, 1.16; 2.5, 2.6

should keep tempc^2, it helps

------ NORMALIZATION ----
Zscore			2.3, 2.2; 1.12, 1.06

Seems like it doesn't matter, I'm going to keep it

------ PATIENCE ---------
patience = 20		1.07, 0.98; 1.44, 1.56 (time=95s as opposed to ~85s)
patience = 40		1.68, 1.64; 3.15, 2.68 (time=93s)
patience = 100		2.22, 2.35;
That doesn't seem right, double check patience
