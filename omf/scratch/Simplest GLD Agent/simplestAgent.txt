GOAL
Make a GridLAB-D agent that people with little software experience can modify and extend.

PREREQUISITES
This code only works with GridLAB-D v4.0.

QUESTIONS
XXX What's the API with GridLAB-D? Not C++, too hard. Not MATLAB, it doesn't appear to be supported any more and octave is a pain. Looks like pause/resume is our best bet.
XXX How to pause? Jason Fuller: "It’s been a while since I’ve used it, but the “pauseat” function is pretty handy.  You can’t send in a differential (like +1h), but you can send in absolute datetime values: http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Pauseat"
XXX Good way to values in and out? There are server mode HTTP APIs that can be used to get/set: http://gridlab-d.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Realtime_server
XXX Test feeder? Simple market.
XXX Initial test? Python for convenience. What will it do? Print out the voltage at one house every hour for 24 hours.
XXX Basic proof of concept? Get in to server mode, set a pauseat.
XXX Decent app? Demonstrate getting/setting/stepping.
XXX Doesn't work with GridLAB-D v4.0.
	XXX What's wrong? Strip it down to simplest system just starting stopping server. Does it work? Yes. API is not completely removed in GLD 4.0.
	XXX Do any commands work? No't. urllib2.urlopen('http://localhost:6267/clock').read() -> Invalid return code.
	XXX What about a browser? Can't even hit the root at http://localhost:6267.
	XXX Check the docs? Tried the wget command the docs said would work. It didn't work.
	XXX Read the docs more carefully? need to add /raw/ in the get statements. There was a bug in the docs.
