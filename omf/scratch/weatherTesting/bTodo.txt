TODO
XXX Move scapeAsos.py in to weather.py.
XXX Get aGosedWeather.py running its tests.
XXX Pull the weather data from the new weather.py, ASOS, instead of oldWeather.py.
XXX Figure out how to map new data from ASOS or USCRN to insolation. Decent USCRN done.
XXX Why isn't the weather playing in to the simulation correctly? It needs a tymfile argument. Pure insanity.
OOO Update climateChange function in web.py.
